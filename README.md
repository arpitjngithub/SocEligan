Hello My self Arpit Jain -
Below is the summary of what I have learnt till now in this project-- 

In zeroth week I worked on my Pyhton skills anf OOP in Python.

In First week I learned basics of Deep feedforward neural networks and how mathematics is involved in the working of this. In this week I code for how to generate dummy data on graph and tried to understand how layer by layer works and each lines of code.
I faced some problems some of them were solved by searching them on google and some of them are resolved in the meets by our mentors.

In Second Week I learned Pytorch by the videos provided by our mentors.
In Third week I got familiar with the concepts of nn Modulaion of pytorch also called as basics building blocks for grpahs.

I had learned many interesting things till now and mentors are helping me if I got stuck in any kind of thing.
